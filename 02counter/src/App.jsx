  ðŸ”¹ What is a Hook in React?
A Hook is a special function in React that lets you use React features (like state and lifecycle methods) inside functional components.

ðŸ”¹ Why Hooks?
Before Hooks, only class components could use features like state and lifecycle methods.
Hooks allow functional components to be powerful and stateful â€” making code simpler and cleaner

/*
ðŸ”¹ What is useState?
useState is a hook in React that lets you add state to a functional component.

Before hooks, only class components could have state. Now with useState, functional components can store and update data that changes over time â€” like form inputs, counters, toggle switches, etc.

ðŸ”¹ How does it work?
When you call useState, it returns two things:

1. The current value of the state.

2. A function to update that value.

 const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // 0 is the initial value

ðŸ”¹ Explanation in simple words:

i. count is a variable that holds a number.

ii. setCount is a function that changes the value of count.

iii. When setCount is called, React re-renders    the component with the new count.
